APIs can help you to add functionality to your WordPress plugins and themes. In this tutorial I will show you how to use any API (whether it be from Flickr, Google, Twitter, and so on) with WordPress. You will learn how to connect, collect data, store and renderâ€“everything you need to know to extend your plugin or theme with new functionality!

We will use Flickr as an example, creating a simple widget that displays the latest Flickr images in order of username.
